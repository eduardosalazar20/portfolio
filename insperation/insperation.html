    <h4>What Mister Cartoon speaks to me is his
        art more specially his tattoo artwork and design. To me this gives a sense of a representation of
        the Mexican American art. It is shown in murals and in tattoos a lot of it is displayed in L.A and in
        San Francisco. </h4>

     <h3><em>Luis Pinto</em> </h3>
     <a href="https://luispintodesign.com/">Luis Pinto</a>
    
     <h4> Luis Pinto is a graphic designer that creates
        a lot of colorful designs that are inspired by hispanic culture. This gives me inspiration as the art
        connects to me as I'm hispanic myself. Which for me I want to do design like that in the near
        future as well.</h4>
